## Data

Included within our resources is a 'datasets.zip' file, which contains a selection of Darwin datasets https://github.com/MasterAI-EAM/Darwin/tree/main/dataset. For convenience, you can directly upload this zip file using the following command and then unzip it to access the datasets. Alternatively, if you prefer to use a different dataset, feel free to select any of your choice from the Darwin project repository at Darwin Dataset Collection. Once selected, compress your chosen dataset and upload it for use.


## `LLM_Finetune_For_Solubility_Data.ipynb` is an implementation of Darwin's training script  
reference: `(https://github.com/MasterAI-EAM/Darwin/blob/main/train.py)`

This version has been tested and seems to be producing reliable results.



## `LLM_Finetune_For_Solubility_Data_SFTT.ipynb` uses Parameter Efficient Fine Tunining (PEFT)
