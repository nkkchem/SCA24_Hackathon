Prior to experiments, the DSC setup was calibrated with metallic indium (melting temperature: 156.6 °C; enthalpy of melting: 28.71 J g−1), which upon repeating the experiment showed an acceptable temperature offset of 0.2  °C and melting enthalpy offset of 0.04%. Calibration and the above measurement were carried out at a ramp rate of 5 °C min−1. DSC analyses of crystalline S-NPB and rac-NPB perovskites were carried out by hermetically sealing corresponding crystals (≈5.0 mg) in aluminum pan/lid, and ramping temperature from 25 to 250  °C at a ramp rate of 5  °C min−1. For measurement of S-NPB and R-NPB glasses, samples were prepared by melting S-/R-NPB crystals (≈5.0  mg) in an open aluminum pan and quickly placing it on a metallic steel bench to quench to room temperature. After hermetic sealing, the glassy samples were exposed to a heating cycle with ramp rates of  5°C min−1 over a temperature range from 25 to 185 °C and heated isothermally at 185 °C for a minute, before cooling back to room temperature at ramp rates of 1, 5, and 20  °C min−1. Since the glass transition occurred over a temperature range, the Tg was determined using the midpoint halfheight method. The Tx, Tm, and Td temperatures were calculated using the intersection between the corresponding DSC peak onset with its horizontal baseline. For Tm, the onset temperature signifies the melting temperature of the sample under consideration, whereas the peak temperature corresponds to complete melting of the sample inside the apparatus. The enthalpy of crystallization and melting were calculated by measuring the area under the curve relating heat flow (W g−1)/ramp rate (°C s−1) and temperature.

Thermogravimetric Analysis: TGA measurements were performed on a TA Q50 instrument using a 5 °C min−1 ramping rate from 25 to 300 °C under nitrogen gas flow (40 mL min−1) with samples (≈4.5 mg) of single crystals of S-NPB and rac-NPB perovskite. Glassy S-NPB perovskite sample (3.9 mg) for TGA measurement was prepared by scratching off the melt-quenched glass prepared on soda lime glass substrates"

Two different heating experiments were conducted. In the first, MAPbI3 was heated to 85 °C in five degree steps starting from 25 °C, with data collected for 5 minutes at each holding temperature. The second experiment employed a continuous heating ramp at a rate of 1° min^-1 during which 30 measurements of 120 seconds were performed. Each measurement corresponds to a temperature span of 2 °C; the final temperature of each measurement was recorded in the measurement file. Five empty sample holder measurements were conducted at room temperature in order to establish the chamber background.

Grow crystals within a long, straight, glass tube (Refer to Fig. 1). First dissolve 1.0 mmol (0.278 g) of freshly sublimed PbCl2 (Aldrich; 99.999%) in 7.5 ml concentrated (37 wt %) aqueous HCl (Aldrich; 99.999%). Weigh and add PbCl2 to the tube in an argon-filled glove box, with oxygen and water levels maintained below 1 ppm. Cover the tube with a septum before removing the glove box and adding HCl with a syringe. 

Create a second layer in the crystal tube by gently syringing 15 ml of methanol (Aldrich; anhydrous, 99.8%) on top of the HCl/PbCl2 solution. A relatively sharp interface can be created between the solvent layers due to density differences. On top of the column, add a stoichiometric amount (2 mmol or approximately 0.25 ml) of phenethylamine with a syringe. 

In the experiment, the phenethylamine rapidly dispersed in the methanol but, because of the sharp interface with the HCl solution, formation of the final (C6H5C2H4NH3)2PbCl4 product was very slow.

The remaining precipitate was dissolved and recrystallized in ethanol, then washed with diethyl ether and vacuum-dried overnight. This resulted in S-MePEABr.

Next, S-MePEABr (21.6 mg), butylammonium bromide (15.4 mg), and PbBr2 (36.7 mg) were dissolved in a solvent of γ-butyrolactone (3 mL) and acetonitrile (9 mL) at a temperature of 80° Celsius. This solution cooled at a rate of 1° / hour down to 10° Celsius. The resulting crystals were clear and plate-like.",Circular dichroism spectroscopy,"Thin films of the material were prepared by spin-casting onto a glass substrate and annealing samples on a hot plate (100° Celsius, 10 mins). A Chirascan V100 Plus-Spectropolarimeter was used for measurements. The exciton peak was divided by the absorbance to normalize the CD measurement."
