        "synthesis_description": "Charge 100 ml 2-necked round bottom flask with a mixture of aqueous HI (6.8 ml, 7.58M) and aqueous H3PO2 (1.7 ml, 9.14M). The liquid was degassed by passing a stream of nitrogen through it for 1 min and keeping it under a nitrogen atmosphere throughout the experiment. Dissolve PbI2 (462 mg, 1 mmol) in the mixture upon heating the flask to 120 \u00b0C using an oil bath, under constant magnetic stirring, forming a bright yellow solution. Add solid HC(NH2)2I (172 mg, 1 mmol). Evaporate solution to approximately half its original volume by heating at 120 \u00b0C. Stop stirring and leave solution to evaporate at 100 \u00b0C. Black hexagonal (8 faces) or trigonal (5 faces) crystals of the title compound were precipitated and grown at this temperature. After standing for 2-3 h at 100 \u00b0C, under a nitrogen atmosphere, set temperature to 80 \u00b0C for a further 2-3 h. Repeat the previous step for two more times to reach 60 \u00b0C and 40 \u00b0C at which point the solution was left to come to room temperature by powering off the hotplate. The crystals were collected by filtration and washed with anhydrous EtOH.",

In situ XRD data were collected in asymmetric reflection mode under a static helium atmosphere on an INEL Equinox 3000 (Inel, Artenay, France) equipped with an XRK-900 reactor chamber (Anton-Paar, Graz, Austria), a curved position sensitive detector (Ine, Artenay, France), a copper Ka source and a Ge-(111) focussing mirror.\r\n\r\nTwo different heating experiments were conducted. In the first, MAPbI3 was heated to 85 \u00b0C in five degree steps starting from 25 \u00b0C, with data collected for 5 minutes at each holding temperature. The second experiment employed a continuous heating ramp at a rate of 1\u00b0 min^-1 during which 30 measurements of 120 seconds were performed. Each measurement corresponds to a temperature span of 2 \u00b0C; the final temperature of each measurement was recorded in the measurement file. Five empty sample holder measurements were conducted at room temperature in order to establish the chamber background.\r\n\r\nRefer to Page 5633 Results and discussion; Page 5634 Figure 4 and Figure 5.",

GeI4 (580 mg, 1 mmol) was dissolved in the mixture upon heating the flask to 120 \u00b0C using an oil bath, under constant magnetic stirring, forming a bright yellow solution. To it, CH3C(NH2)2I (184 mg, 1 mmol) was dissolved. The solution was evaporated to approximately half its original volume by heating at 120 \u00b0C. The stirring was discontinued, and the solution was left to cool down to room temperature. Upon cooling, the crystals formed, and they were allowed to grow for 24 h.

The mixture was degassed by passing a stream of nitrogen through it for 1 min. The following procedure was performed under N2. GeI4 (580 mg, 1 mmol) was dissolved in the mixture upon heating the flask to 120 \u00b0C using an oil bath, under constant magnetic stirring, forming a bright yellow solution. To it, (CH3)2C(H)NH3I (187 mg, 1 mmol) was dissolved. The solution was evaporated to approximately half its original volume by heating at 120 \u00b0C. The stirring was discontinued, and the solution was left to cool down to room temperature. Upon cooling, the crystals formed, and they were allowed to grow for 24 h.

After soaking at 80\u00b0C for 12 hours, the solution was cooled to -10\u00b0C at 2\u00b0C/hour. The product was filtered under nitrogen, dried in flowing argon at 80\u00b0C for several hours, and then removed to an argon-filled dry box with oxygen and water levels maintained at <1 part per million. The [NH2C(I)=NH2]2(CH3NH3)4Sn4I14 crystals could be mechanically separated from the rod-like or rhombic dodecahedral cubic perovskite crystals because of the very different crystalline habit for these two materials.",

Substrates were dried by a nitrogen gun, transported into the glove box, and preheated to 80\u00ba C.

Inside a 4 mL vial, as-synthesized 4TCNm (10.6 mg, 20 \u00b5mol) and PbI2(4.6 mg, 10 \u00b5mol) were dissolved in a mixture of DMF (1 mL) and CB (1 mL). Afterward, the solution was diluted 60 times with acetonitrile/chlorobenzene (1:2:5 volume ratio). The solution was diluted 5 more times with either CB or CB/acetonitrile (3:1 volume ratio). Next, the Si/SiO2 substrates were then cleaned via ultrasonication in isopropanol, water, acetone, and isopropanol again. Substrates were dried by a nitrogen gun, transported into the glove box, and preheated to 80\u00ba C. The prepared, diluted solution was then dropped onto the Si/SiO2 substrate, 10 mL at a time, and dried at 80\u00baC. Thin sheets of (4TCNm)2PbI4 grew spontaneously within 10 minutes. Thin polycrystalline films were annealed at 100\u00ba. Though the organic ligand was too large (and approaching the extent of the perovskite\u2019s lattice), a yellow solid product resulted.",

Slow cool at 2 \u00b0C/h to 0 \u00b0C, to form small, yellow, sheetlike crystals of the desired (AEQT)PbBr4 compound.

The DAC was cooled to lower temperatures and raised to higher temperatures (between 274 and 310 K); each temperature was measured when the diamond was a consistent temperature. Current-voltage curves were generated from -40 to 40 mV at a scan rate of 1 mVs^{-1}, and conductivity was calculated by using slope of averaged curves, sample thickness, and distance between leads.",

The air was then replaced with argon, and toluene (20 mL) was added to the mixture. The mixture was stirred for 0.5 hours at 100\u00ba C, cooled to room temperature, water was added, and the solution was extracted via dichloromethane (DCM). The organic layers were combined, washed, and dried. \r\n\r\nNext, 4Tm-Boc (1 mmol) was dissolved in 20 mL methanol, aqueous HI solution was added, and the solution was stirred for 6 hours.

As a result, PbBr2 immediately precipitated and after 15 minutes of stirring, the solution was cooled to room temperature. The PbBr2 was filtered under vacuum, washed with distilled water, and dried overnight. This product was used in the synthesis of CsPbBr3. The PbBr2 (20 mmol, 7.31 g) was dissolved in 30 mL of HBr (48% wt.). A pale, yellow solution resulted, and CsBr (20 mmol, 4.26 mg) was dissolved in 10 mL of H2O. A bright orange solid immediately precipitated. The solid was suction filtered, washed with EtOH, dried under vacuum. Finally, the Bridgeman Method was performed to obtain single crystals. 6g of CsPbBr3 were ground with mortar and pestle, placed in a silica tub (OD/ID: 9mm/7mm), and the tube compilation was brought to a 10^{-4} mbar vacuum and flame-sealed.

After 2 hours of stirring the solution became yellow and transparent, and passed through a filter with pore sizes of 0.2 microns. The solvent was allowed to evaporate at room temperature for 2-3 days, leaving behind chunky, black crystals. To produce thin films, the crystals were first dissolved in DMF to produce a transparent and yellow solution. 3-4 drops of the solution were put on a glass plate and heated to 155 degrees Celsius. A small puddle of about one square centimeter formed and within a minute began depositing black solid around its circumference. A caption sheet was used to spread the remaining solution evenly over the glass slide. A dark red film was formed on the glass slide and was kept at 155 degrees Celsius for another 2 minutes. XRD confirmed the formation of the layered perovskite structure.",

The mixture was heated and stirred at reflux for 2 days. The mixture was then cooled to room temperature. The precipitate was isolated by filtration, washed with diethyl ether, and dried. \r\nThen, stoichiometric amounts of PbI2 (purchased from Sigma Aldrich) and PyrEAI were added to concentrated stabilized aqueous HI. The concentration of the solution was maintained at 0.25-0.30M of Pb2+. The solution was heated at 140\u00baC and stirred for an hour.

Then, dissolve 0.03 g of the obtained crystals in dimethylformamide (DMF) (0.8 mol/L) in a small uncovered vial, and place it in a larger vial holding dichloromethane (DCM). Over a week-long period, the DCM vapors diffuse into the vial with the DMF solution and produce yellow flaky single crystals ((S-2-MeBA)2PbBr4) as well as S-2-MeBA salt, light-yellow needle-shaped crystals. The crystals were filtered, washed with ethyl ether, and vacuum-dried. The (S-2-MeBA)2PbBr4 crystals can be separated from the salt crystals under a microscope, and they were then used for single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SC-XRD).",

The instrument was under helium purge with a 5 K/min ramp from 298 K to 124 K and back to 298 K (with use of an LN2P cooler). Sample powder was loaded into a Tzero Hermetic aluminum pan, with temperature and enthalpy calibrated in advance.\r\n\r\nA similar instrument was used to perform high-temperature DSC measurements under nitrogen purge. The ramp rate was 5 K/min from 298 K to 603 K. An aluminum pan was hermetically sealed to contain samples.",

Addition of the n-CH3(CH2)3NH3I solution to the PbI2 solution initially produced a black precipitate, which subsequently dissolved under heating the combined solution to boiling. The stirring was then discontinued, and the solution was left to cool to room temperature during which time black rectangular-shaped plates started to crystallize. The precipitation was deemed to be complete after \u223c2 h. The crystals were isolated by suction filtration and thoroughly dried under reduced pressure.",

The laser beam was focused at about 1 \u00b5m spot size was made parallel to the 010 orientation of the crystals. The power output of the laser source was limited to 0.1% of the maximum power output.",

Then, dissolve 0.03 g of the obtained crystals in dimethylformamide (DMF) (0.8 mol/L) in a small uncovered vial, and place it in a larger vial holding dichloromethane (DCM). Over a week-long period, the DCM vapors diffuse into the vial with the DMF solution and produce yellow flaky single crystals ((S-2-MeBA)2PbI4) as well as S-2-MeBA salt, light-yellow needle-shaped crystals. The crystals were filtered, washed with ethyl ether, and vacuum-dried. The (S-2-MeBA)2PbI4 crystals can be separated from the salt crystals under a microscope, and they were then used for single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SC-XRD).",

        "synthesis_description": "A hot-injection approach was used to synthesize cesium lead iodide quantum dots. Cs2CO3 (0.25g, 99.9%), OA (0.98 mL, 90%), and ODE (9 mL, 90%) were mixed in a 25 mL three-neck flask and vacuum dried at 120 degrees Celsius for one hour through the use of a Schlenk line. Cs2CO3 was dissolved by heating the solution to 150 degrees C for 10 minutes, and this initial solution was then kept at 100 degrees C to prevent precipitation. \r\nPbI2 (120 mg, 99.99%) and ZnI2 (250 mg, 99.99%) were dissolved in a blend of ODE (5 mL), OAm (2 mL), and TMPPA (2 mL) at 120 degrees C for one hour. This solution was then set to a reaction temperature dependent upon the desired QD size (between 145 and 190\u00b0C). \r\nThe initial solution (0.4 mL) was injected into the second solution, and after 20 seconds the flask was quenched in an ice bath. To separate QDs from unreacted salts, the product was centrifuged for 30 minutes at 1,290 g. QDs were collected and, after methyl acetate was used to isolate the QDs, they were suspended in hexane.",

        "experimental_description": "QD films were spin-coated onto glass substrates (2000 rpm, 40 seconds) and mounted to a liquid nitrogen cooling system for this experiment. A 1030 nm laser was split into two beams (80% and 20%). The 80% beam pumped an Orpheus-HP optical parameter amplifier and generated a tunable pump beam, while the 20% was split again into two parts (75% and 25%). The 75% beam was focused into a 13-mm yttrium aluminum garnet crystal in order to create a white light probe beam. This probe beam was focused onto the sample with a parabolic reflector, then into a fibre-coupled spectrometer (10 kHz frequency). Pump pulses were chopped at 5 kHz before absorbance change was calculated with 10 pump-blocked pulses and 10 pump-unblocked pulses.",
